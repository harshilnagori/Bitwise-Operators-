# Bitwise-Operators-

**Aim:** To learn basic bitwise operators
**Software:** VS Code/Programiz
**Theory:**
    Bitwise AND (&): Performs AND on each bit. Only bits that are 1 in both numbers remain 1.

    Bitwise OR (|): Performs OR on each bit. Bits that are 1 in either number become 1.

    Bitwise XOR (^): Performs exclusive OR. Bits are 1 only if the corresponding bits are different.

    Bitwise NOT (~): Flips all bits (including the sign bit, which affects the value in two's complement representation).

    Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left, filling with zeros. Equivalent to multiplying by 2^n.

    Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right. For unsigned numbers, fills with zeros; for signed numbers, implementation-dependent (usually arithmetic shift).

**Conclusion:** We learnt how to use and apply Bitwise Operations using Bitwise Operators in C++.
